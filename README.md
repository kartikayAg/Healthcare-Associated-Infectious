Healthcare-Associated-Infectious
A public repository for the management and prediction of Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) using Big Data, Python, and Machine Learning.

Project Overview
Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) present a significant challenge in modern healthcare. This project leverages big data analytics and machine learning to predict, monitor, and manage HAIs through integration of diverse data sources, real-time analytics, and actionable dashboards.

Key Features
Data Integration: Combines EHRs, IoT devices, lab results, and clinical notes.
Feature Engineering: Automated extraction of clinical risk features.
Machine Learning Models: Comparative evaluation (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting, etc.).
Visualization: Dashboards and plots for model insights and risk stratification.
Real-Time Monitoring: Concepts for streaming data integration (Kafka/Spark).
Compliance: Adherence to HIPAA/GDPR principles in code/data handling.
